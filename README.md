Potentially hazardous asteroids are small
celestial bodies that can be harmful in the sense that
they could collide with Earth, leading to serious
consequences such as damage and loss of life.

Therefore, the detection of such asteroids is
important in order to take preventive actions. In this
paper, we explore the use of various machine learning
algorithms to detect potentially hazardous asteroids.

We have used supervised learning models that can
accurately classify asteroids as hazardous or
non-hazardous. We have utilized a large dataset
provided by JPL and NASA in the training phase of
the machine learning models. 

We further evaluate the
performance of the models using metrics such as
accuracy, f-score, precision, and recall.
